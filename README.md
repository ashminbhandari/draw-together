# draw-together

This app works on localhost, however, I discarded this idea and moved onto a bigger project which encompasses drawing as well as piano jams. 

Using fabric.js to merge images took too much memory. In the newer project, p5.js and p5-sound.js will be used which uses lesser data points among other things.
